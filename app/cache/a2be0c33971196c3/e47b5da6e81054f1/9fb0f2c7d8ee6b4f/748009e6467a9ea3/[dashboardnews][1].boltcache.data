We're hard at work on Bolt 2.0, but in the six weeks since the last update, a lot of minor improvements were made by us and our contributors. Quite a few of the changes in this version are nice, little improvements, and we wanted to get them out sooner rather than later. Read <a href="http://bolt.cm/newsitem/bolt-150-released">the details here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68);">This release also has a few improvements that will make the transition&nbsp;to Bolt 2.0 even smoother, scheduled for release in a month or two. Version 2.0 will be awesome, by the way!</span><br>
